## Here we write general notes about the annotator

After talk with Ankur, we decided following features:
+ Interpolation --- Linear and flow based.

[Flow based interpolation for multiple frames will be done by interpolating between neighboring frames at a time and
progressing]
+ Keyboard based navigation & ~~downloading annotations~~
+ buttons had to be organized.
+ Puppet has to be color-coded so that one can differentiate between automatically generated key-point and human
tagged key-point. Also there has to be a button so that user can say that the puppet is OK or well-tagged and can be
used for interpolation (We decided to have a button or marker for this roughly at the center of mass of puppet)
+ A help guide to be shown at the side or some other way to guide the user.
